## 🚀 Tomorrow: Phase 2 Planning

### Phase 2 Goals
**CHAPTERS AND BUNDLES**

From your original docs, Phase 2 includes:
- Chapter mapping for books
- Bundle access system
- Resolution logic (Bundle → Book → Chapter)

### What We'll Build
1. **ChapterMap Contract**
   - Map books to their chapters
   - Define chapter IDs and metadata
   - Chapter-level access control

2. **BundleAccess Contract**
   - Create bundles (collections of books)
   - Bundle-level access grants
   - Inherit access logic from Phase 1

3. **Resolution Logic**
   - Access checks cascade: Bundle → Book → Chapter
   - Verify user can access requested content level

### Preparation Tasks
- Review existing AccessToken contract
- Design chapter/bundle data structures
- Plan contract interactions
- Update documentation structure

---

## 📋 Before Starting Tomorrow

### Optional: Post Weekly Rewards Submission
If you want to submit Phase 1:
1. Open `FINAL_SUBMISSION_THREAD.md`
2. Copy tweets 1-8
3. Post on Twitter/X with screenshots
4. Tag @base and use #BaseWeeklyRewards #BuildOnBase

### Files to Review
- `docs/phase-0/entity-relationships.md` - Entity definitions
- `docs/phase-0/id-patterns.md` - ID structure
- `src/AccessToken.sol` - Phase 1 contract to extend
- `src/ProofOfRead.sol` - Reading records to integrate

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Success Criteria

By end of Phase 2, we should have:
- [ ] ChapterMap contract deployed
- [ ] BundleAccess contract deployed
- [ ] Both contracts tested with interactions
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Integration with Phase 1 contracts verified

---

## 💡 Key Learnings from Phase 1

1. **Foundry is fast** - Deployment and testing was quick
2. **Base is cheap** - Only $0.0033 for everything
3. **Documentation matters** - Having templates saved time
4. **Test early** - Interaction scripts validated everything
5. **GitHub organization** - Clean structure made submission easy
